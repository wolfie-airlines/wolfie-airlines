    🇬🇧 DESCRIPTION
  </summary>

# Description
Wolfie Airlines is an airport and airline project created for a college credit project. From the very beginning of programming this project, I felt a special bond with it. I wanted to create something incredibly unique. I hope that I managed and lived up to my expectations.

## Walk-through

<details>
  <summary>
    🧭 START MENU
  </summary>
  
  Users can use the app without creating an account or logging in, but it has limited features, of course.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🧭 USER MENU
  </summary>

  What appears to our eyes is the user menu, which has many more functions than the basic start menu.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8V1i80v.png"/>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    👤 USER PROFILE
  </summary>

  Any self-respecting application that supports account creation should have the ability to review your own profile. At `Wolfie Airlines` we take our customers really seriously.
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8O1tjna.png"/>

  The profile is mainly used to view statistics, such as verified occupation, current premium card/current assigned discount, money saved, date of account creation, default payment method (`you can change it in the settings, as mentioned below`), number of tickets purchased, or amount of money spent.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ⚙️ SETTINGS
  </summary>

  In addition to being able to view your own account, you can also edit it. Changing the password, email address, username, etc. are incredibly necessary for users' satisfaction with the application.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QgMZW2k.png"/>

  <details>
    <summary>
    👷‍♂️ JOB VERIFICATION
    </summary>

  Each user has the opportunity to verify the occupation he or she is pursuing, which brings benefits. Currently, the application supports 5 professions: `musician`, `doctor`, `mathematician`, `informatician` and `police officer`, and the benefits are as follows:
  - `musician` - **free^** transportation of musical instruments.
  - `doctor` - **free^** carriage of medical assortment (first aid kits, emergency kits, vaccines, etc.) and assortment needed to practice the profession (stethoscope, etc.).
  - `mathematician` - **free^** carriage of calculator and abacus.
  - `informatician` - **free^** carriage of tools needed for the profession (laptop, tablet, computer) and **free^** carriage of unlimited amounts of electrical devices (with lithium or lithium-ion batteries).
  - `policeman` - **free^** carriage of tools needed for the profession (weapons, ammunition) and **free^** and `exclusively available to this profession`, carriage of prohibited items such as: `stun weapons`.

**^** - `free` means: Available (if prohibited), not counting towards baggage weight

  <details>
    <summary>
    🎵 Musician
    </summary>

  Verification of the occupation involves a test of hearing. A short part of a well-known song is played and the user's task will be to correctly guess the artist/band that created the song.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/m0AXn5p.png"/>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
    💉 Doctor
    </summary>

  Verification of the occupation involves diagnosis of the disease. Symptoms are displayed, based on which the user must determine the disease.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FUIr22v.png"/>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
    🧮 Mathematician
    </summary>

  Verifying an occupation involves solving a math problem. A question is displayed, to which the user must provide the correct answer, consistent with the displayed hint.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wewXZU7.png"/>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
    💻 Informatician
    </summary>

  Verifying an occupation involves solving a computer problem. A random problem from a random programming language is displayed, and the user's task will be to indicate which line of code contains the error.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fipamv7.png"/>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
    🚓 Policeman
    </summary>

  Verification of the profession involves providing the `correct' badge number

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fIDsbXe.png"/>
  </details>
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    💳 CHANGE THE DEFAULT METHOD OF PAYMENT
  </summary>

  The application currently supports 2 types of payments: `BLIK code` and `VISA card`.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/g9xlIUL.png"/>
</details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    💳 PREMIUM CARDS
  </summary>
    
  The user in the app has the option to purchase a premium card, which at a later stage gives various benefits.
  The best benefit - *most developed* - is the choice of seat on the plane, available only for `gold card and platinum card`.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fTi2bC1.png"/>

  To purchase a card, all you have to do is enter the name of the card and then pay for it.

  `If a user has purchased a premium card, he/she cannot apply for a discount.`
 </details>

 <details>
  <summary>
    🪙 DISCOUNTS
  </summary>
    
  In addition to premium card support, we also offer discounts for: `war veterans`, `disability card`, `retirees` and `students`.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ELk14vZ.png"/>


  `If a user has a discount assigned to their account, they can no longer purchase a premium card.`
 </details>

 <details>
  <summary>
    ✈️ DISCOUNTED FLIGHT PREVIEW
  </summary>

  Whether with a discount from a concession or a premium card, each displays the same, only displaying different prices (depending on the % discount).
  Below you will find the displayed screen of discounted flights for `war veteran`:
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CKRRSdP.png"/>
 </details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🔎✈️ FLIGHT SEARCH
  </summary>

  Searching for flights is the first and basically the most important function of the entire application, so it is also one of the most extensive in terms of the criteria specified by the user.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tIAQShv.png"/>

  The options are indeed many, as you can see in the attached image. For example, let's choose the option to view all flights.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aaSx7Cd.png"/>

  We displayed the entire screen with the ability to *paginate* (change pages) between the displayed flights.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🎫 PURCHASING TICKETS
  </summary>

  Let's say we've already selected the flight we're interested in using the previously described option. Now it's time to purchase a ticket for it!
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s9lZpxS.png"/>

  Let's use a more accurate function for the purpose of the presentation (more accurate because each flight has its own unique `identifier`, so, using the number *1* option, will always return us the correct connection.
  For example: if, using the number *2* function, we specify the city of departure and arrival, the application may return us 2 connections, but with different dates. So it is recommended to use the flight ID, which can be obtained by using the flight search engine.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2yQfu4L.png"/>

  So we confirm, returned by the application, the flight and go to the next screen.

  <details>
  <summary>
    🎫✈️ CHOICE OF SEATS ON THE PLANE (EXCLUSIVE FOR GOLD AND PLATINUM CARD)
  </summary>

  If the user has, as described below, a `premium card`: **gold or platinum**, he/she is entitled to the benefit of choosing seats on the plane.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nBS3zx0.png"/>

  To select the seats, you need to specify one by one:
  - **number of tickets to purchase** (minimum `1`, maximum `4` per user).
  Assuming that we want only `one` ticket we will need to specify:
  - Number of `row`.
  - The number of the `seat`.
  If we want a pair of tickets, the application will ask for all row and seat numbers. You should then follow the instructions displayed in the application.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VFf4Wwl.png"/>

  We have selected seats. The airplane is displayed, and the app itself asks you to confirm your selection:
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ctt8AZA.png"/>
</details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    🎫✈️ SEAT ALLOCATION (FOR OTHER USERS)
  </summary>

  Seat allocation for users without a gold or platinum premium card is done using an `algorithm' implemented, based on official airline data:
  - If there are free seats on the plane, it allocates randomly
  - If the only seats on the plane are evacuation seats and the user has none of the concessions: `war veteran`, `disability card`, `emeritus`, he is assigned an evacuation seat.
  - Otherwise, on the other hand, if the user has the above-mentioned concessions, the application prompts whether the user still wants to purchase a ticket for an evacuation seat
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🎫💵 TICKET PAYMENTS
  </summary>

  If we have confirmed our choice of seats on the plane, or it has been assigned to us top-down, you must pay for the tickets.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gc1ciPK.png"/>

  The payment screen displayed depends on the **default payment method** selected by the user. The basic one is `BLIK`, which can be changed in the settings described above.
  After a successful payment, an invoice with the purchased tickets and check-in information is printed for us.

</details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🎫 MY TICKETS
  </summary>

  The user can, of course, see the purchased tickets and their check-in statuses (baggage and tickets)
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SZauO7a.png"/>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🎫 TICKET CHECK-IN
  </summary>

  We have searched and found a flight, bought a ticket, there are check-ins left. The first one, of course, does not have to be the ticket check-in, but that is the order the app suggests to us.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uzN0PPP.png"/>

  The application displays our tickets and asks us to enter the flight number (present on the ticket border, in the attached image it is `#1`. We enter without the `#` character, of course.

  <details>
  <summary>
    🤳 QR CODE
  </summary>

  The check-in system at `Wolf Airlines` is strongly forward-looking, fast and efficient. For you only need to scan a QR code to carry out the entire check-in process. You don't have to enter anything, give anything, let alone - pay extra.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iBFZuPg.png"/>
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    📑 BOARDING PASSES
  </summary>

  After scanning the code, it will take us to [project website](https://github.com/wolfie-airlines/wolfie-airlines-webpage), which will then communicate with [server](https://github.com/wolfie-airlines/wolfie-airlines-server) to perform our check-in.
  All we have to do is wait a few seconds and we will receive our finished boarding passes.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pZhsV9W.png"/>

  Now, if the user enters the `My Tickets` tab, he will see ✅ in the check-in column next to the checked-in ticket.
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    👜 BAGGAGE CHECK-IN
  </summary>

  We're already checked in (or rather, our ticket), so what's left is to check in our luggage. It is known that sometimes it is possible to fly with just a backpack, in which case such an option is not required, you may see ❌ in the `My tickets` tab, but flying on a **2 week** vacation, it is hard to pack in a mountain backpack. So it is also necessary to check in our suitcase or bag separately.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kwLC9KK.png"/>

  Initially, the baggage check-in looks very similar to the ticket check-in so that the user goes through it more intuitively. Also, you need to select the flight for which you want to check in your luggage.

  <details>
  <summary>
    👜 WELCOME TO THE CHECK-IN
  </summary>

  Feel at ease with us. At `Wolf Airlines` you can be sure that we will always welcome you with open arms. Before checking in your luggage, you also have the option to view a list of all available and prohibited items for air transportation.
  All information contained in the application is based on real data from the table of lists of dangerous items - [Table 2.3a](https://www.royaljet.pl/uploads/Wykaz_przedmiotow_niebezpiecznych.pdf).
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pEMA2Kl.png"/>
  </details>

<details>
  <summary>
    🛄 LIST OF ALL ITEMS
  </summary>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kw0gghD.png"/>

  The table is very easy to read and intuitive, so that the user knows for sure whether he can take an item.
  If you want to get detailed information about one item (availability for a profession, average weight of one item) just enter its `number`.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    👜 CONTENTS OF LUGGAGE
  </summary>
    
  If the user does not need a table of all items, he/she moves to the next check-in screen.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MhT8KcP.png"/>

  Here it is necessary to mark all the things that the user wants to take with him. As you can see, some items have appeared in **red**. These are prohibited items. 
Someone may ask: Why include prohibited items in the baggage check-in at all? The answer is very simple. Namely, **these items are not forbidden to everyone**, for example, a `stun weapon` is available and not forbidden to a person who is in the profession of a *police officer*. Of course, for this person, such an item does not display in red. For an ordinary user, this is only a visual information, and when selecting this item without authorization, the check-in will fail.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    👜 CONFIRMATION OF BAGGAGE CONTENTS
  </summary>
    
  If the user has selected items, the app displays a list of the things he or she has selected so that he or she can calmly check again if he or she has forgotten something.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jJ3O7i4.png"/>
 </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    👜 QUANTITATIVE SUMMARY
  </summary>
    
  After confirming that the contents of your luggage are compatible, the next check-in screen appears, asking you to enter the number of items you want to take.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tJw6fll.png"/>

  The `weight of items is calculated automatically`. Each item has its own predetermined weight to make baggage check-in go more smoothly.
  
  As you can see in the attached photo, baggage up to **20kg** inclusive, is baggage checked in immediately, for free, without any surcharge.
  If you exceed the weight limit of **20kg**, but do not exceed **32kg**, you will be charged an excess baggage surcharge, according to official [Ryanair](https://www.ryanair.com/pl/pl) data, that is: `€2 for each kilogram exceeded`.
  The overpayment is calculated in złoty, at a predetermined exchange rate (it is not updated, it is a fixed `4.3zl`).
 </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    💵👜 EXCESS BAGGAGE CHARGE
  </summary>
    
  When the user exceeded the aforementioned weight limit, but fit within the maximum limit, an excess baggage surcharge was applied.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i3jVhAW.png"/>

  As is standard with all in-app payments, a screen prompts for payment, after which, if successful, the baggage is automatically checked in.
 </details>
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
    🤵 ADMIN PANEL
  </summary>
    
  The application also offers an administrator panel, for those with a senior pass to the `Wolfie Airlines` office headquarters (administrator password)
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JaOGxuj.png"/>

  If the user has not been logged in as an administrator before, the application will ask him or her to enter a password, while if he or she has been, he or she will immediately go to the panel.

  <details>
  <summary>
    ⚙️ PANEL FEATURES
  </summary>
    
  The admin panel supports the following functions:
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JaOGxuj.png"/>

  - `FLIGHTS` - adding new flights.
  - `VERIFICATION QUESTIONS` - adding new verification questions (for competition verification).
  - `USER MANAGEMENT` - changing user name, email, money spent, date of account creation, number of tickets purchased, etc.
  - `ADDING NEW ITEMS` - new items to the item table in the baggage check-in.
 </details>

 </details>

## Requirements (for your own use)
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) - Package Manager, my advice: use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) environment that has it built in
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Software Build System, again my advice: use the above mentioned environment.
- [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) - Style Library
- [MongoDB Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/fundamentals/clusters) - Cluster for the MongoDB database
- [mongo-cxx-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver) - C++ MongoDB driver
- [mongo-c-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver) - C MongoDB driver used to build driver for `mongo-cxx`
- [cryptopp](https://cryptopp.com/) - Cryptographic library, used in this project to hash a user's password
- [QR-Code-Generator](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator) - A library that provides all the necessary functionality to generate a QR code, *needed for online check-in*.
- filling the database with core files so that the program has something to read data from. The files I used are available in the [database](https://github.com/wolfie-airlines/wolfie-airlines/tree/main/database/json) folder in `JSON` format.

## Self-hosting & self-building
1. clone the repository, or create a fork.
2. Install and configure `vcpkg manager` in the cloned project.
3. download all required libraries using `vcpkg manager`.
4. modify the `.env.example` file:
  - Rename it to `.env`.
  - Fill in `DATABASE_URL` using its full address to connect to the MongoDB cluster. *Example link*: `mongodb+srv://username:password@testcluster.taymr.mongodb.net/test`.
  - Fill in `ADMIN_PASSWORD` using your administrator password. You can make them up, there is absolute freedom here.
5. Reload the project using the CMake tool (`Reload CMake project with existing CMakeLists.txt`).
6. build the project using any environment or compilation tool.
7. Launch the project is a simple matter:
  To launch the project, I recommend a terminal that supports Polish characters (such as **Powershell**), or clone [English fork](link-to-English-fork).
  - If the project has not been renamed, launch it as follows:
    ```bash
    ./airport.exe
    ```
  - If the project name has changed:
    ```bash
    ./project_name.exe
    ```
### Important information
If you are using the [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) environment, a `cmake-debug-build` folder will be created if you are currently running on **debug** mode. It is set by default, so there is a 99% chance of this happening.
To properly run this project, you need to move the `.env` file and the entire `sounds` folder to it to ensure that the application runs correctly.

## Stars
If you like my project, give it a star, it will be very nice for me.
